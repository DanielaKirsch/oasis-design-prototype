      <h1>Planning Notes</h1>

      <p>Your Specialist is: <a href="nick.html">Nick Page</a></p>
      <p>In preparing your travel plans, as per our conversation, I have taken in to account the following;</p>

      <h2>Summary </h2>


<p>As discussed I have created an exciting three and a half week private tailor-made holiday to China, basing the plans around our recent e-mail correspondence.</p>

<h2>Dates of Travel</h2>
<p>You would like to travel in April and would like to be away for around 24-26 days including flying time. You have some flexibility with dates but need to avoid Golden Week (01-07 May 2017).</p>

<h2>Accommodation</h2>
<p>In regards to hotels, your preference is small, luxury boutique style hence I have made suitable suggestions. I have personally visited the majority of properties so just let me know if you have any specific questions or would like any alternative options.</p> 

<h2>Special Interests</h2>
<p>A general overview of the history and culture of the country. To take in the big cities as well as the more rural and pretty areas of the country missed out by most “coach tour” style holidays to China. </p>

<h2>Weather</h2>
<p>April is a great time weather wise to visit China, with generally bluer skies and less air pollution. It can be a little chilly in some of the more mountainous destinations such as Yunnan.</p>

<h2>Flights</h2>
<p>The current best value flights in and out of Brisbane are with Cathay Pacific, who also have great connection times. A stopover in HK can be added if required – but this will increase the airfare by approximately $120pp. </p>
