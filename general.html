      <h1>General Information</h1>


      <h2>Health issues</h2>
<p>Please consult with your doctor at least 6 weeks before travel to Asia. <br>
Charges for medical care are usually settled in advance before any treatment, including for emergency care, so good medical insurance is essential. Any essential medicines should be taken with you as they may not be available locally. </p>

<h2>Deep vein Thrombosis (DVT)</h2>
<p>The issue of DVT on long haul flights has recently received a lot of publicity. Most international airlines now offer on board advice on how to lessen the risk. However, if you have concerns regarding DVT we recommend that you talk to your doctor. </p>

<h2>Government travel advice</h2>
<p>The best source of up to date travel advice for Australian citizens is the government run Smart Traveller website, located at 
<a href="http://www.smartraveller.gov.au">http://www.smartraveller.gov.au.</a>

</p>

<h2>Existing health issues & disabled passengers</h2>
<p>Due to the adventurous nature of the destinations we feature it is essential that you inform us before booking of any pre-existing medical conditions that you feel could be relevant. In the many cases our itineraries are not suitable for the less mobile and wheelchair bound. We will of course be delighted to discuss the feasibility of modifying any itinerary where possible so as we can accommodate you safely. </p>

<h2>Dietary requirements</h2>
<p>Please inform us at the time of booking if you have any specific dietary requirements so we can pass them on in plenty of time to any relative hotel and/or airline.</p>

<h2>Smoking</h2>
<p>If you require non-smoking rooms please let us know at the time of booking and we will request them on your behalf.<br>
Smoking is not permitted in any of the transfer vehicles we use. Where you are on long road journeys regular stops will be made where you will be able to smoke. </p>

<h2>Health and safety standards abroad</h2>
<p>Health and safety standards in the countries we operate tours to are not of the same high standards found in Australia and each country has its own regulations and enforcement levels. With this in mind we recommend that you always check where the nearest fire exit is and how to raise the alarm should it be necessary to do so. </p>

<h2>Passports & Visas</h2>
<p>All passengers must be in possession of a passport which is valid for a period of at least 6 months following the return date of your holiday.</p> 

<p>Pre obtained visas are required in some destinations. It is your responsibility to check if you require a visa and to obtain it. Please refer to the Oasis Travel website – “Travel Info – Visas” for more information and purchasing of the relevant visa.</p> 

<h2>Hotel bedding information & single rooms</h2>
<p>Terminology describing bedding in hotel rooms is often confused. <br>
Double room – a room with a double bed or two single beds pushed together.<br>
Twin room – a room with two single beds.  Triple rooms are usually a Double Room plus an extra bed, very few hotels cater for 3 single beds in a room.
</p>

<p>Single rooms – single rooms, where available, tend to be smaller than twin and double rooms often with a single bed. However, most hotels in the regions Oasis Travel deals with do not have single rooms and where this is the case you will be allocated a twin or double room.</p> 

<p>Please note that hotel rooms are allocated solely at the discretion of the hotel. We can make requests to the hotel on your behalf but unfortunately these requests cannot be guaranteed.</p>

<h2>Itinerary accuracy</h2>
<p>Many of our destinations we organise travel to are in the developing world where infrastructures and attitudes differ greatly from our own. Whilst every effort is made to keep to the planned itinerary occasionally due to factors beyond our control roads may close, airlines reschedule or government regulations change. Should there be any changes we will, where possible, endeavor to inform you before your departure.</p> 

<p>Please also be aware that English is not usually the first language of the people you will be dealing with when encountering these frustrating situations, please ensure you maintain an air of calm and try to see the funny side of these situations – we and our in-country partners are only ever a phone call away should you need assistance.</p>
