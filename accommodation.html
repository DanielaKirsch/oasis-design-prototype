      <h2>Shichahai Shadow Art Hotel – Beijing</h2>
      <p>Shichahai Shadow Art Hotel is located in a quiet Hutong just a few minutes from the Mansion of Prince Gong and an ideal location from where to discover Beijing. It is within easy walking distance of Houhai - the famous imperial lake area of Beijing, with its many bars and restaurants. Yandai Hutong, which is full of souvenir shops and cafes, is also not far. Likewise it is within walking distance of the Drum Tower, Bell Tower, Beihai lake and Nanluoguxiang, another trendy street chock full of shops and eateries.</p>


<p>The small restaurant serves snacks and a local and western breakfast, but to be honest there are loads of great places to eat within easy walking distance of the hotel.</p>

 <p>What this little hotel lacks in facilities is more than made up for in sheer charm, great Hutong location and “memorability” factor. Don’t worry when you first arrive and think “where are we” you will soon begin to appreciate the authentic hutong location. It is the best little hotel in its class and offers excellent value for money. </p>

      <h2>The Zen Garden Hotel (Lion Hill) - Lijiang</h2>
           <p>The Zen Garden Hotel, Lion Hill Yard is located in the heart of the Old Town of Lijiang next to the entrance of the Wan Cheng Temple on the Lion Hill with great walking access to all the major places of such as the Water Mill, Si Fang Square, Mu Palace, Wang Gu Lou Pagoda. It is situated in the pedestrianised area of the Old Town – from the parking lot it is approximately a 1 minute walk to the hotel.</p>

      <p>The Zen Garden Hotel Lion Hill Yard has two very beautifully Naxi-Style courtyards constructed from timber and natural stone. The reception and the teahouse are decorated with traditional Chinese antique furniture, vases, paintings and fine art wood carvings from the Ming and Qing Dynasty.</p> 

      <p>This small boutique hotel has just 16 rooms split over two levels. All have a small balcony with seats facing to the open courtyard from where guests can enjoy the sunshine. The well equipped en suite rooms have flat screen TV and DVD and there are even laptop computers that you can borrow to use in the rooms with the free hi-speed internet (not Wi-Fi)</p>

      <p>The second courtyard is home to the small restaurant that serves mainly local dishes with a few western choices. The view of the traditional grey over the UNESCOW World Heritage listed city is second to none and a great back drop from where to try the famous local PU-ER tea blend.</p>

      <p>The Zen Garden Hotel, Lion Yard is one of the best value and most characterful hotels in the whole of China. It is slightly rough around the edges but this is all part of its charm. Its location is second to none and the staff are friendly and helpful.</p>
