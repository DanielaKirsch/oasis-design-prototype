<h2>Value for Money</h2>
<p>We review our prices on a regular basis and we strive to offer the best value for money possible. Please refer to our price guarantee on the quotation page.</p>

<h2>Personal Service</h2>
<p>Oasis is committed to offering the very best in personal service. Your travel plans will be handled by one point of contact, your consultant will be responsible for the smooth operation of your trip from start to finish.</p>



<h2>Detailed Itineraries</h2>
<p>Oasis itineraries are designed to be comprehensive and clear, enabling you to make an informed choice about your holiday plans as well as giving you a thorough outline of what is and is not included in the price.</p>

<h2>Quality Local Partners and Support</h2> 
<p>Oasis have handpicked our local agents taking in to account their quality of service and the condition of their vehicles. Our guides are there to do much more than just provide facts and figures and accompany you to the major sites. They will tell you about local life, customs and cuisines and when necessary act as a translator. On some itineraries specialist guides will be supplied such as on wildlife excursions. If you have any specific requirements in terms of guide, such as photography or ancient history please do not hesitate to ask us at the time of planning and we will endeavour to arrange it for you.</p>

<h2>Mishaps En-route</h2> 
<p>If a problem does occur on your trip (and yes, occasionally things will happen that are out of anyoneâ€™s control) our local agents will have a 24 hour emergency number and we will also give you our 24 hour Australia contact number. We will endeavour to correct any problem as soon as possible.</p>
