          <h3>Beijing - Introduction - Population: 12 million</h3>
          <p>
          China's capital city is a dynamic and fast-growing metropolis that keeps a tight grip on its rich cultural heritage as well as embracing rapid modernisation and still adhering to a strict Communist social order. The city is of colossal proportions and can often give a distorted view of China to foreign visitors. Beijing is both modern city with high-rise buildings, shopping malls and vast international hotels connected by an intricate freeway system crisscrossing the city. However, the contemporary buildings often mask traditional hutongs, parks, numerous architectural treasures and beautiful temples whose prayer flags and wind chimes dance in the gentle breeze produced by the passing traffic. </p>

          <p>

           The highlights of the city are as numerous as they are varied. The best good place to initiate exploring the city is Tiananmen Square, where Mao Tse Tung declared the foundation of the People’s Republic. From the square you can see the imposing majesty of the Forbidden City to the north and the vast portrait of Chairman Mao on the Tiananmen Gate. Other more serene places of interest include the Summer Palace and Temple of Heaven and of course, The Great Wall. For the foodies out there, there are some excellent restaurants in the city.   We really recommend that you spend a day or so extra in Beijing to really soak up the amazing sights and sounds of the capital. Spend a little time in the public parks where you will see the locals practising Tai Chi, singing and even ballroom dancing, spend an afternoon in the traditional ‘hutongs’ narrow busy backstreets crammed with local markets and incense filled temples and really immerse yourself into this rich and complex society. </p>

<h3>Tiananmen Square & Forbidden City</h3>

<p>Tiananmen Square is the largest public square in the world, covering over 44 hectares and is always filled with tourists from all around world. In the middle of the Square is the Monument to the People's Heroes. Directly to the north is Chang'an Avenue, Beijing's main street. Across the street you will find Tiananmen Gate, which is immediately recognizable by the huge portrait of Mao Zedong. The square was the place where, in 1989 the prodemocracy movement was so viscously quashed by the government and resulted in the death of so many students and demonstrators.</p>

<p>Tiananmen Gate is the gate which leads to the Forbidden City (aka The Palace Museum or Purple Forbidden City). The Forbidden City was built between 1406 and 1420 during the Ming Dynasty and was the imperial home of 24 emperors of the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. From their throne in the Forbidden City, they governed the country by holding court sessions with their ministers, issuing imperial edicts and initiating military expeditions.</p>

<p>After the republican revolution in 1911, the youngest and last emperor of the Qing Dynasty, then still a child, abdicated the next year. But he, his family and their entire entourage were allowed to stay in the palaces. They were finally expelled by republican troops in 1924. It has been the Palace Museum to the public since 1950. The Forbidden City is one of the largest and best-preserved palace complexes in the world. There are over a million rare and valuable objects in the Museum.</p>

<h3>Temple of Heaven - Introduction</h3>
<p>The temple complex was constructed from 1406 to 1420 during the reign of the Yongle Emperor, who was also responsible for the construction of the Forbidden City in Beijing. The complex was extended and renamed Temple of Heaven during the reign of the Jiajing Emperor in the 16th century. The Jiajing Emperor also built three other prominent temples in Beijing, the Temple of Sun in the east, the Temple of Earth in the north and the Temple of Moon in the west. The Temple of Heaven was renovated in the 18th century under the Qianlong Emperor.</p>

<p>The Temple of Heaven was extolled as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1998 and has been described as a masterpiece of architecture and landscape design that illustrates the cosmos and of great importance for the evolution of one of the world’s great civilizations. The symbolic layout and design of the Temple of Heaven has had a profound influence on architecture and planning in the Far East over many centuries.</p>

       <h3>Tour</h3> 
<p>by private vehicle with personal driver and guide<br>
Beijing to the Great Wall, approximately 90 mins</p>

<h3>The Great Wall of China - Introduction</h3>
<p>China's most iconic attraction, The Great Wall of China, was built over 2,000 years ago by Qin Shi Huangdi, the first emperor of China during the Qin Dynasty (221 B.C - 206 B.C.). It is the longest man-made structure in the world with the main wall being around 2,145 miles long with an extra 1,770 miles of branches and spurs.   The wall was originally conceived as a way of protecting various empires from attack from the northern hordes, but because the Great Wall was discontinuous, the Mongol invaders led by Genghis Khan had no problem going around the wall and they subsequently conquered most of northern China between A.D. 1211 and 1223. They ruled all of China until 1368 when the Ming dynasty defeated the Mongols. The wall has been added to at various stages of its history, most famously by the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) following their defeat of the Mongols.</p>
 
<p>It is the remnants of the stone and brick walls predominately from the Ming dynasty upgrade that survive today. The most visited section of the Great Wall is in Badaling, close to Beijing. It was the first section of the wall to open to tourists in 1957 and is where President Nixon visited and was the finish site to one of the cycling events in the 2008 Summer Olympics. Badaling can get very crowded and there are lots of hawkers so we generally recommend heading further out of Beijing to the much quieter Jinshanling or Mutianyu sections of the wall.</p>

<h3>The Summer Palace by private vehicle with personal driver and guide</h3>
<p>The Summer Palace is located on the western edge of Beijing. As its name implies, the Summer Palace was used as a summer residence by China's imperial rulers - as a retreat from the main imperial palace now known as the Palace Museum (or 'Forbidden City') - a pleasure ground in the countryside, yet near to the city. It is a museum of traditional Chinese gardening that uses rocks, plants, pavilions, ponds, cobble paths and other garden styles to create a poetic effect between different scenes. The garden can be historically divided into three parts, namely the administration, residence and scenery areas. The administration area, take in the Halls of Benevolence and Longevity as its principal part, is the place where the Qing dynasty's dowager empress Ci Xi dealt with state affairs and received officials. The residence area mainly consists of the Hall of Jade Billows, the Garden of Virtue and Harmony, and the Hall of Joyful Longevity. Kunming Lake and Longevity Hill form the scenery browsing area. After the Great Wall and the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace is the next 'must see' place to visit for any visitor.</p>

Beijing to the Great Wall, approximately 90 mins</p>

<h3>The Great Wall of China - Introduction</h3>
<p>China's most iconic attraction, The Great Wall of China, was built over 2,000 years ago by Qin Shi Huangdi, the first emperor of China during the Qin Dynasty (221 B.C - 206 B.C.). It is the longest man-made structure in the world with the main wall being around 2,145 miles long with an extra 1,770 miles of branches and spurs.   The wall was originally conceived as a way of protecting various empires from attack from the northern hordes, but because the Great Wall was discontinuous, the Mongol invaders led by Genghis Khan had no problem going around the wall and they subsequently conquered most of northern China between A.D. 1211 and 1223. They ruled all of China until 1368 when the Ming dynasty defeated the Mongols. The wall has been added to at various stages of its history, most famously by the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) following their defeat of the Mongols.</p>
 
<p>It is the remnants of the stone and brick walls predominately from the Ming dynasty upgrade that survive today. The most visited section of the Great Wall is in Badaling, close to Beijing. It was the first section of the wall to open to tourists in 1957 and is where President Nixon visited and was the finish site to one of the cycling events in the 2008 Summer Olympics. Badaling can get very crowded and there are lots of hawkers so we generally recommend heading further out of Beijing to the much quieter Jinshanling or Mutianyu sections of the wall.</p>

<h3>The Summer Palace by private vehicle with personal driver and guide</h3>
<p>The Summer Palace is located on the western edge of Beijing. As its name implies, the Summer Palace was used as a summer residence by China's imperial rulers - as a retreat from the main imperial palace now known as the Palace Museum (or 'Forbidden City') - a pleasure ground in the countryside, yet near to the city. It is a museum of traditional Chinese gardening that uses rocks, plants, pavilions, ponds, cobble paths and other garden styles to create a poetic effect between different scenes. The garden can be historically divided into three parts, namely the administration, residence and scenery areas. The administration area, take in the Halls of Benevolence and Longevity as its principal part, is the place where the Qing dynasty's dowager empress Ci Xi dealt with state affairs and received officials. The residence area mainly consists of the Hall of Jade Billows, the Garden of Virtue and Harmony, and the Hall of Joyful Longevity. Kunming Lake and Longevity Hill form the scenery browsing area. After the Great Wall and the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace is the next 'must see' place to visit for any visitor.</p>

Beijing to the Great Wall, approximately 90 mins</p>

<h3>The Great Wall of China - Introduction</h3>
<p>China's most iconic attraction, The Great Wall of China, was built over 2,000 years ago by Qin Shi Huangdi, the first emperor of China during the Qin Dynasty (221 B.C - 206 B.C.). It is the longest man-made structure in the world with the main wall being around 2,145 miles long with an extra 1,770 miles of branches and spurs.   The wall was originally conceived as a way of protecting various empires from attack from the northern hordes, but because the Great Wall was discontinuous, the Mongol invaders led by Genghis Khan had no problem going around the wall and they subsequently conquered most of northern China between A.D. 1211 and 1223. They ruled all of China until 1368 when the Ming dynasty defeated the Mongols. The wall has been added to at various stages of its history, most famously by the Ming dynasty (1368-1644) following their defeat of the Mongols.</p>
 
<p>It is the remnants of the stone and brick walls predominately from the Ming dynasty upgrade that survive today. The most visited section of the Great Wall is in Badaling, close to Beijing. It was the first section of the wall to open to tourists in 1957 and is where President Nixon visited and was the finish site to one of the cycling events in the 2008 Summer Olympics. Badaling can get very crowded and there are lots of hawkers so we generally recommend heading further out of Beijing to the much quieter Jinshanling or Mutianyu sections of the wall.</p>

<h3>The Summer Palace by private vehicle with personal driver and guide</h3>
<p>The Summer Palace is located on the western edge of Beijing. As its name implies, the Summer Palace was used as a summer residence by China's imperial rulers - as a retreat from the main imperial palace now known as the Palace Museum (or 'Forbidden City') - a pleasure ground in the countryside, yet near to the city. It is a museum of traditional Chinese gardening that uses rocks, plants, pavilions, ponds, cobble paths and other garden styles to create a poetic effect between different scenes. The garden can be historically divided into three parts, namely the administration, residence and scenery areas. The administration area, take in the Halls of Benevolence and Longevity as its principal part, is the place where the Qing dynasty's dowager empress Ci Xi dealt with state affairs and received officials. The residence area mainly consists of the Hall of Jade Billows, the Garden of Virtue and Harmony, and the Hall of Joyful Longevity. Kunming Lake and Longevity Hill form the scenery browsing area. After the Great Wall and the Forbidden City, the Summer Palace is the next 'must see' place to visit for any visitor.</p>
