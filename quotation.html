<p>Important note – please check that the above names are spelt correctly (as per your passport). If they are incorrect you may be refused boarding to your flight or check in at hotels.</p>
<h2>Price guarantee</h2>
<p>If you receive an identical quote before booking from one of our Australian competitors that appears to be cheaper in price, Oasis promises to match it. Just send us a copy of the quote and we will compare the two and reply with a detailed explanation, as in our experience we invariably find differences, some often quite apparent and others more subtle. Feel free to remove the competitor name if desired. We guarantee to match the alternate quote; no questions asked if it is for the same services!</p>


<h2>Not included in the price </h2>
<ul>
  <li>Local airport departure taxes; where collected locally</li>
  <li>Travel Insurance</li>
  <li>Any meals other than specified</li>
  <li>Items of a personal nature such as laundry, drinks, telephone calls etc.</li>
  <li>Applicable Visa’s</li>
  <li>Tips for your driver/guide (discretionary)</li>
  <li>Camera or video fees where applicable</li>
  <li>Any costs incurred in “free time”</li>
  <li>Possible future fuel surcharges levied by airlines</li>

</ul>


<h2>Notes</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Unless otherwise stated, where vehicles with drivers are included they will be made available to you between 8am and 5pm, usually with a one or two hour break for lunch. If you require their services beyond these hours please arrange this directly with the driver. Please contact us if you have any specific further requirements.</li>
  <li>Entrance fees are only included to the mentioned sites and only for single entry. If you contract the driver/guide directly for additional site seeing any applicable entrance fees must be paid locally at your own expense.</li>
  <li>All services are on a PRIVATE basis unless otherwise stated; you will not be expected to share guides or transportation. We believe this offers the greatest flexibility and quality of service.</li>

</ul>


<h2>How to book</h2>

<p>If you are happy with the arrangements as outlined within the itinerary and would like us to go ahead and confirm the itinerary please return the completed booking form (either by e-mail or post to PO Box 336 Kenmore  QLD 4069) and return to us along with your deposit (or full payment where applicable).</p>

<h2>Payment by credit card</h2>

<p>Please note that whilst we do not charge a credit card fee on deposits but when paying the balance or where the full payment is due we will pass on the fee charged by the relevant credit card company, currently between 1.5% to 3.5%. We have elected to make this transparent rather than just include it in to the price of your holiday. To avoid this extra charge you may want to consider paying by personal cheque or electronic fund transfer (EFT).</p>
